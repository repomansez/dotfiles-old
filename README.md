My Arch Linux + dwm dotfiles
------------
In this repository you'll find all the dotfiles for my Arch Liinux installation. Dotfiles may include personal information (e.g. username, directories) that will not work in your computer, so keep that in mind if you wish to replicate my configurations into your own system.

Is it FOSS?
------------
I try my best to keep my computer proprietary-software free, but it is not possible to get completely rid of it considering that, for example, Youtube and some other sites are my main source of entertainment, and all of them require proprietary shit to be installed.

May I replicate your configs in my own computer?
------------
You certainly can do it if you want, but I don't recommend git clonning this repo and trying to use my configs integrally, because it will most likely not work and I WILL NOT give support for people trying to do this, but feel free to copy anything you see in this repo and feel free to make a pull request if you think you did something better than me.
